# scripts
In the following, I provide some of my recent sample scripts.

Note that these scripts serve to demonstrate my scripting abiliity. It requires specific libraries and platform to run up to completion.

This main script is:

/for_microbenchmarks/run_64_8_8g_run5.sh

It calls python scripts (from the /for_microbenchmarks/base_scripts/ directory) to profile, find the optimal mapping, and run the benchmark. The same process is then repeated by calling the python scripts (from the /for_hoomd/base_scripts/ directory) for the HOOMD-blue application.
